Socket Python Server

This Python project is centered around a straightforward socket server that fulfills three primary functions: accepting client connections, receiving data from these clients, functioning as a control server for efficiently recording incoming data.

Project Structure is organized as follows:

├── server/
│   ├── server.py               # Socket server initialization
│   └── handler.py              # Functions for server validation and operations
├── storage/                    # Directory to store files
└── readme.md                   # Guidance and configurations
